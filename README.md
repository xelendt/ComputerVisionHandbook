# ComputerVisionHandbook
A source of resources for those interested in learning computer vision. 

A good place to start is playing around with _OpenCV_. Here are some of the samples that come with the library:

OpenCV also has an overview of most of the features they support at:

OpenCV 2.4: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html

OpenCV 3.0.0: http://docs.opencv.org/3.0.0/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html

Installation tutorials can be found under the *Introduction* pages on these tutorials.

If you'd like a more formal background on computer vision, there are several courses that have been uploaded to YouTube.
